𐙚 My precious dear, 𐙚

All I want for Christmas is you.

You’re the greatest gift I could ever ask for.
Your love makes every day warmer, and every moment more meaningful.
Being with you is what makes this season truly special, and I’m so grateful to spend Christmas knowing I have you by my side.

Christmas has always been about warmth to me—
pretty lights in the dark,
and quiet moments that feel like home.

Ever since we spent our first Christmas together, something in my heart settled ✮⋆✮
like I finally found where I belong.
From that moment on, every future Christmas I imagined had you in it.

And I still feel that way.

No matter the year, no matter where we are,
you are my favorite part of this season…
and every season after.
