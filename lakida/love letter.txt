I made a whole website for YOU!! I hope you enojy it :D;
meoww;
I love how when you don't know the month you count with your fingers to figure it out;
I love how when you are really really happy you kick your legs to the side when running;
I love how when you get happy or excisted you do you're little AI cat dance, it's addorable;
You really do make my life so much brighter I don't care how much you try to fight it;
I can't wait for you to finally accept I'm never going to leave you becuse I love you with my whole heart;
Every moment with you has been genunine bliss I love you more then words could begin to discribe;
I love looking into your pretty brown eyes they are so deep and delicate;
I pretend to look around but I'm actually only looking for you.;
For you? I would give you the world if it was in my hands;
a hero would sacrafice one person to save the world. I would gladly watch the world burn for you.;
I wasn't looking when I met you. But you turned out to be everything I was looking for.;
Hug me until I forget my own scent;
Hug me until I smell like you;
I know we're way too young and it's still to early but I KNOW you're the one.;
Please keep talking I love the soudn of your voice.;
Please keep talking your voice is genuine music to my ears;
if you fall, I'll pick you up. if not, I will simply lay down beside you.;
I know I can't promise to fix all your problems, but I can promise you will never have to face them alone again.;
You have a place in my heart no one else ever could have;
I feel so much better right next to, thank you for always being there even at my worst moments;
I will love you, always and forever.;
and you my dear, is a reminder that there is beuattty in this world we live in;
if you were a rose, you would be the most exquiste bloom, delicate and fragrant with petals that glowed like pearls in the sun;
I know for a fact I would see you among the stars;
You are the best thing that has ever happened to me;
I still remember the feeling I felt when I first started talking to you.;
Sometimes when I'm at my lowest without you I use our photos, an videos to make myself happy;
Even when you're mad at me I still find the buety in your face and dimples that form.;
You have no idea how badly I want your name to light up my phone;
Everytime I check my phone I smile due to the fact there is a chance the notifcation was from you.;
And if you're thinking of me? I'm likely thinking of you.;
I am yours. even before we got together. I was yours.;
sometimes late at night our memories sneak out of my eyes and roll down my cheek;
I've never loved someone in my life as much as I've loved you, thank you.;
Hand in hand. you and me. today , tomorrow, Forever.;
If I'm being honest it was a disturbingly short amoutn of time between meeting you and wanting to say "I love you";
I may never find words beautiful enough to descrive all that you mean to me, but I will spend the rest of my life searching for them.;
How could I ever begin to love someone else when at night all my thoughts are full of you?;
How can I love someone new, when every night I dream of you?;
I may not always be there with you, but I will always be there for you.;
You don't need to have everything figured out, we can figure it all out together;
it's so hard for me to put you into words because I love you in ways I have never loved anyone else.;
I love when you look at me because I know for at least one split second, I was on your mind.;
I love you for what you are, for what you have been and whatever you will be.;
I may be gone one day, but you wil still be in my heart;
no matter what you do what you say my heart has and always will beat for you;
Even if I die someday I hope you are able to live on with the fact I loved you up until my last breath,;
I promise my last beating pulse will flow with love for you.;
If I get buried in the gruond the maggots will choke on my love for you;
It was that smile. the first time I saw it, I knew I wanted to see it for the rest of my life.;
When I think about love I think about you;
are these cheesy enough?;
I always think of you;
you were never just anyone to me. you are my everything.;
you exist in my world in a way that no one does.;
you're all my favorite songs trapped in a soul;
Since you've been aroudn I smile a LOT more than I used to.;
You feel like home to me,;
