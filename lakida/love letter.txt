I made a whole website for YOU!! I hope you enjoy it :D;
meoww;
I love how when you don't know the month, you count with your fingers to figure it out;
I love how when you are really, really happy, you kick your legs to the side when running;
I love how when you get happy or excited, you do your little AI cat dance, it's adorable;
You really do make my life so much brighter, I don't care how much you try to fight it;
I can't wait for you to finally accept I'm never going to leave you because I love you with my whole heart;
Every moment with you has been genuine bliss, I love you more than words could begin to describe;
I love looking into your pretty brown eyes, they are so deep and delicate;
I pretend to look around, but I'm actually only looking for you.;
For you? I would give you the world if it was in my hands;
A hero would sacrifice one person to save the world. I would gladly watch the world burn for you.;
I wasn't looking when I met you, but you turned out to be everything I was looking for.;
Hug me until I forget my own scent;
Hug me until I smell like you;
I know we're way too young and it's still too early, but I KNOW you're the one.;
Please keep talking, I love the sound of your voice.;
Please keep talking, your voice is genuine music to my ears;
If you fall, I'll pick you up. If not, I will simply lay down beside you.;
I know I can't promise to fix all your problems, but I can promise you will never have to face them alone again.;
You have a place in my heart no one else ever could have;
I feel so much better right next to you, thank you for always being there even at my worst moments;
I will love you, always and forever.;
And you, my dear, are a reminder that there is beauty in this world we live in;
If you were a rose, you would be the most exquisite bloom, delicate and fragrant with petals that glowed like pearls in the sun;
I know for a fact I would see you among the stars;
You are the best thing that has ever happened to me;
I still remember the feeling I felt when I first started talking to you.;
Sometimes when I'm at my lowest without you, I use our photos and videos to make myself happy;
Even when you're mad at me, I still find the beauty in your face and the dimples that form.;
You have no idea how badly I want your name to light up my phone;
Every time I check my phone, I smile due to the fact there is a chance the notification was from you.;
And if you're thinking of me? I'm likely thinking of you.;
I am yours. Even before we got together, I was yours.;
Sometimes late at night, our memories sneak out of my eyes and roll down my cheek;
I've never loved someone in my life as much as I've loved you, thank you.;
Hand in hand. You and me. Today, tomorrow, forever.;
If I'm being honest, it was a disturbingly short amount of time between meeting you and wanting to say "I love you";
I may never find words beautiful enough to describe all that you mean to me, but I will spend the rest of my life searching for them.;
How could I ever begin to love someone else when at night all my thoughts are full of you?;
How can I love someone new when every night I dream of you?;
I may not always be there with you, but I will always be there for you.;
You don't need to have everything figured out, we can figure it all out together;
It's so hard for me to put you into words because I love you in ways I have never loved anyone else.;
I love when you look at me because I know for at least one split second, I was on your mind.;
I love you for what you are, for what you have been, and whatever you will be.;
I may be gone one day, but you will still be in my heart;
No matter what you do or what you say, my heart has and always will beat for you;
Even if I die someday, I hope you are able to live on with the fact I loved you up until my last breath;
I promise my last beating pulse will flow with love for you.;
If I get buried in the ground, the maggots will choke on my love for you;
It was that smile. The first time I saw it, I knew I wanted to see it for the rest of my life.;
When I think about love, I think about you;
Are these cheesy enough?;
I always think of you;
You were never just anyone to me. You are my everything.;
You exist in my world in a way that no one does.;
You're all my favorite songs trapped in a soul;
Since you've been around, I smile a LOT more than I used to.;
You feel like home to me;
No matter how much time I spend with you, I always end up wanting more.
FINE YES I'M GREEDY, YES I WANT ALL YOUR TIME, YES I WANT ALL YOUR ATTENTION, YES I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU;
I promise your heart is safe with me;
I promise I'm nothing like your past, I will guard your heart with mine;
All my favorite days are the ones I have spent with you.;
I've really never been good at telling people how I feel, but fuck, you make me want to try.;
I can't wait to see you again;
This website will be up forever. Maybe when I'm gone, you'll come and check in and see how much I loved you;
Thank you for the happiest years of my life.;
Love is such a fucking understatement for how I feel about you;
I've always known something was missing in my life. When you came, I realized it was you all along;
Thank you for finding me when I was lost;
Somehow, just hearing your name gives me butterflies.;
Every day I find myself loving you even more than the last;
Even if I do die, promise me you'll never forget about me? I know I'll find a way to come back to you one way or another;
Trust me, I like it when you smile, but I like it SO much more when I'm the reason;
Not a day goes by I don't think of you;
Not a night goes by I don't dream of you;
You're the one I stay up all night thinking about, coming up with cute things to do with you;
I love you more than the stars fill the sky;
I love you more than the sun lights the day;
I know I'm going to love you forever;
Before I met you, I never knew what it was like to be able to look at someone and smile for no reason.;
Sometimes I get so far gone thinking about you;
The day I met you, I began to forget a life without you.;
P.S. I might have forgotten to tell you, but I really do love you;
Everything is better with you. Everything has been better since you.;
I wish our kisses never had to end;
It was that day I knew... you were my forever;
And just like all the love songs that had no meaning to me were full of it;
Suddenly, all the love songs were about you;
And suddenly, you were all I could talk about;
Thank you for making me feel comfortable being exactly who I am.;
Thank you, Lakida. Thank you for being with me above all else. I love you more than anything;
Not talking to you fucking kills me;
For you, I'd steal the stars;
If you wanted me to, I would gladly steal the world to put it in your hands;
I like to be alone, but I would MUCH rather be alone WITH YOU!!!;
Because of you, I know heaven without death;
I know dreams come true because mine did when I finally went out with you;
